# ECE2524_Project3
This repository is for ECE 2524 Project 3 and Homework Assignment.

Ideas for Project3:

# Twitter
- Data Scrapper for Twitter
- Mastermind
  - Ask any question on Twitter using a specific hashtag (Ex: "#ECE2524 What is the color of the sky")
    - Question will be captured and the payload will be sent to wolfram
  - Question will be answered and the answer will be sent to a text file

- New project idea I will pursue
  - Enter any twitter user, mine/collect all of their tweets [TWITTER API]
  - Parse through tweets, and detect if there if any of their tweets contain profanity
    - This idea seemed interesting to me since I have my twitter currently set to Private, but if I have a lot of tweets so it would take       me a while to look through all my tweets since 2011. If there is a bad tweet sometime a long the way, I can see what it is and it's       time stamp so I can delete it
  - The tweets that have been flagged will then be outputted to a textfile
