# ECE2524_Project3
This repository is for ECE 2524 Project 3 and Homework Assignment.

Ideas for Project3:

# Twitter
- Data Scrapper for Twitter
- Mastermind
  - Ask any question on Twitter using a specific hashtag (Ex: "#ECE2524 What is the color of the sky")
    - Question will be captured and the payload will be sent to wolfram
  - Question will be answered and the answer will be sent to a text file
